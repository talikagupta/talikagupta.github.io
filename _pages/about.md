👋 Hello, I'm Talika Gupta. I'm currently a final year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

I'm interested in AI, Systems and Theoretical Computer Science. 

🚀 My journey in the world of technology has taken me from exploring cutting-edge research in language technology at the University of Hamburg to crafting innovative solutions in computer vision at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad.

🎓 Academically, I take pride in securing the top rank in my program, with a GPA of 9.85/10. My commitment to excellence has been recognized with prestigious achievements such as the DAAD Scholarship 2023 and outstanding performance in the PACE Challenge 2023.

💡 When I'm not delving into code or immersed in research, I enjoy contributing to the tech community as a teaching assistant and Google Developer Student Club ML Lead. 

🔍 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/talika-gupta) and check out my coding adventures on [GitHub](https://github.com/talikagupta). Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!

✨ Let's innovate, learn, and build the future together.
