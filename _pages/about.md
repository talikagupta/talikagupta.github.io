👋 Hello, I'm Talika Gupta, a passionate and results-driven computer science enthusiast based in Guwahati, India. I'm currently a final year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
I'm interested in AI, Systems and Theoretical Computer Science. 

<!--🚀 My journey in the world of technology has taken me from exploring cutting-edge research in language technology at the University of Hamburg to crafting innovative solutions in computer vision at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad.

🎓 Academically, I take pride in securing the top rank in my program, with a GPA of 9.85/10. My commitment to excellence has been recognized with prestigious achievements such as the DAAD Scholarship 2023 and outstanding performance in the PACE Challenge 2023.

💡 When I'm not delving into code or immersed in research, I enjoy contributing to the tech community as a teaching assistant and Google Developer Student Club ML Lead. My volunteer experiences range from mentoring fellow students to teaching mathematics to underprivileged girls.

🌐 Explore my diverse projects, from developing heuristic algorithms for graph theory challenges to implementing reinforcement learning-based service recommendation frameworks. I thrive on tackling complex problems and turning ideas into tangible solutions.
